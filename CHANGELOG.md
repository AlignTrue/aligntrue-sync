# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`aligntrue team join` subcommand** - Onboard new team members by creating their personal (gitignored) config without mutating team files. Replaces the previous auto-create behavior in sync
- **`aligntrue add source` subcommand** - Add sources via CLI with `aligntrue add source <url>`. Replaces `--link` flag for the `add` command. Use `--personal` to mark source as personal scope
- **`aligntrue add remote` subcommand** - Add push destinations via CLI with `aligntrue add remote <url>`. Use `--personal` or `--shared` to configure scope routing
- **`aligntrue backup --yes` flag** - Skip confirmation prompts for restore and cleanup subcommands. Useful for CI/scripts

### Changed

- **Team mode simplified** - Removed `lockfile.mode` soft/strict options; lockfile is now enabled via `modules.lockfile: true` and drift enforcement happens via `aligntrue drift --gates` in CI. Lockfile generation now runs once after exports and respects `--dry-run`
- **Git sources in team mode warn instead of block** - Sync now continues with cached git sources when updates are available; add `--strict-sources` to block until updates are approved
- **BREAKING: Team lockfile simplified to bundle hash only** - Lockfile v2 now contains only `version` and `bundle_hash` (hash of team rules + `config.team.yaml`). Per-rule sections, timestamps, mode fields, and provenance were removed. Drift detection compares only the bundle hash for reliability and easier Git-based review
- **Drift command reduced to single `lockfile` category** - `aligntrue drift` and `--gates` now report only lockfile drift with clearer remediation (“run aligntrue sync” + git diff). JSON/SARIF outputs and help text updated accordingly
- **Team sync uses unified backup flow** - Sync continues to back up agent exports before overwrite; lockfile generation/regeneration now always uses the simplified v2 format and includes team config in the hash
- **BREAKING: Removed `--link` flag from `aligntrue add` and `aligntrue init`** - Use `aligntrue add source <url>` instead. For init, first run `aligntrue init` then `aligntrue add source <url>` to add connected sources
- **BREAKING: GitProvider default path changed** - Git source provider now defaults to `"."` (directory scan) instead of `.aligntrue.yaml`. Remote rule repos should contain markdown rules in directories, not single YAML files
- **BREAKING: Backup restore flag standardized to `--timestamp`** - `aligntrue backup restore` now uses `--timestamp` flag instead of `--to` for consistency with `aligntrue revert`
- **Internal: ResolvedSource returns Align directly** - Source resolver no longer serializes to YAML and re-parses. Simpler data flow, fewer allocations
- **Internal: `aligntrue check` modularized** - Schema, lockfile, and overlay validation now live in dedicated helpers with unit coverage for easier maintenance
- **Team sync prompts for join when personal config is missing** - `aligntrue sync` now detects team repos without a personal config and offers to run `aligntrue team join` (with non-interactive hint)
- **Git mode switching cleans .gitignore** - Switching to `commit` or `branch` mode now removes AlignTrue managed ignore entries so generated files are tracked

### Removed

- **BREAKING: Severity remapping and `.aligntrue.team.yaml`** - Removed remap config, APIs, and tests. Team config is solely `.aligntrue/config.team.yaml`
- **BREAKING: Bundle module and agent export hash tracking** - Removed `modules.bundle`, `.agent-export-hashes.json`, and agent-file drift category. Drift now relies on lockfile bundle hash; per-agent export drift detection was redundant with backups and sync overwrite flow
- **BREAKING: Watch mode command (`aligntrue watch`)** - Removed vestigial feature from bidirectional sync era. Rules change infrequently, making continuous file watching unnecessary. Replaced with pre-commit hook guidance and editor integration patterns in [CI/CD integration guide](/docs/01-guides/07-ci-cd-integration). Schema fields `watch_enabled`, `watch_debounce`, `watch_files` removed from config
- **BREAKING: `aligntrue link` command removed** - The incomplete vendoring feature has been removed. For rules stored in git submodules or subtrees, use `type: local` sources instead with the path to the vendored directory. This is simpler and already works
- **BREAKING: `vendor_path` and `vendor_type` fields removed** - Vendoring metadata removed from lockfile entries, drift detection, and schema. The "vendorized" drift category no longer exists
- **BREAKING: `keep_count` backup config** - Removed deprecated count-based backup retention. Use `retention_days` (default: 30) and `minimum_keep` (default: 3) instead
- **Deprecated frontmatter fields** - Removed `private` (use `gitignore`), `source`, `source_added`, `original_path`, and `original_source` from RuleFrontmatter. Provenance tracking moved to audit log (`.aligntrue/.history`)
- **Legacy drift category `local_overlay`** - Use `overlay` instead. The category was never produced by any code path
- **Deprecated function `scanForExistingRules`** - Use `scanForExistingRulesWithOverlap` with `detectOverlap: false`
- **Deprecated function `addPrivateRulesToGitignore`** - Use `addGitignoreRulesToGitignore`
- **`rules` field from ScopedExportRequest** - Exporters now use `align.sections` exclusively. The field was never populated
- **Telemetry feature** - Removed local-only telemetry system that collected data with no transmission mechanism. Feature was not delivering value without collection infrastructure
- **URL source provider** - Removed deprecated `type: "url"` source provider. The JSON schema already rejected this type, and the provider was never instantiated. Use git repositories instead for remote rule sources
- **BREAKING: `remote_backup` config removed** - Legacy config field and conversion helpers are gone. Use `remotes` exclusively; CLI backup/sync commands no longer fall back to `remote_backup`

### Fixed

- Sync now rejects invalid `--content-mode` values with exit code 2 and guidance
- `aligntrue migrate` without a subcommand exits non-zero instead of silently showing help
- `aligntrue remotes push`, `backup push`, and `sources split` fail fast in non-interactive/no-remote scenarios for CI-friendly gating
- **CRITICAL: Config data loss when adding remotes or sources** - Fixed destructive bug where `aligntrue add remote` and other CLI commands would delete user configuration (sources, exporters, plugs, etc.) when updating config. The old `saveMinimalConfig` function incorrectly dropped user values that matched defaults. Replaced with `patchConfig` which surgically updates only the specified keys, preserving all other user configuration exactly as written
- **`enabled: false` frontmatter now prevents rule export** - Rules with `enabled: false` in frontmatter are now correctly excluded from all agent exports. Previously the field existed in schema but was not enforced
- **Disabled rules flagged as stale** - When a rule is disabled, existing multi-file exports (e.g., `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) are now reported as stale so they can be cleaned with `aligntrue sync --clean`
- **Lockfile creation timing in team mode** - Lockfile is now created immediately when team mode is enabled, rather than waiting for first sync. Provides immediate feedback and allows git tracking from the start
- **Sources split non-interactive mode** - `aligntrue sources split --yes` now fully suppresses intro/outro messages for better CI/automation support
- **Documentation examples updated** - Git source and solo guide documentation now uses markdown rule examples instead of obsolete YAML format
- **Documentation accuracy for git sources and exporters** - Updated all reference docs to reflect new directory scan default (`.`) for git sources and `align.sections` usage in `ScopedExportRequest`. Removed references to `.aligntrue.yaml` file-based rules and deprecated `keep_count` backup config
- **Exporter content mode typing** - Single-file exporters now read `sync.content_mode` via a typed helper instead of `any` casts
- **Uninstall cleanup** - `aligntrue uninstall --delete-exports --delete-source` now removes AlignTrue-managed agent ignore files (e.g., `.cursorignore`) and prunes empty export directories for all supported agents instead of leaving empty folders behind
- **Team config validation in personal files** - `aligntrue config set` no longer errors about missing `mode` when team config already defines it
- **Non-interactive add source guidance** - `aligntrue add source` in team mode now explains to use `--personal` or edit `config.team.yaml` (removes misleading `--shared` hint)

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-01

### Changed

- Updated dependencies in `@aligntrue/schema`: `yaml` from 2.8.1 to 2.8.2, `tsx` from 4.20.6 to 4.21.0

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Init exporter selection streamlined** - Init now shows 5 most common exporters (AGENTS.md, Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, Cline) plus any detected ones, with message to add 14+ more via `aligntrue exporters`. Fixes multiselect rendering with large exporter list
- **GitHub web UI URL support** - URL parser now handles GitHub web URLs with `/tree/` and `/blob/` paths. Copy URLs directly from GitHub's web interface (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/aligns`)
- **Selective import UI for init/add/sources detect** - Smart tiered selection interface when importing rules. Single file: auto-import. Small folder: show list + confirm. Large/multiple folders: show summary + folder-level selection
- **Unified backup system with age-based retention** - All backups consolidated under `.aligntrue/.backups/` (snapshots and files). Individual file backups now use `.bak` suffix for clarity and include timestamp
- **`retention_days` config for age-based backup cleanup** - Replace count-based `keep_count` with intuitive age-based retention (default: 30 days, configurable 0-unlimited)
- **`minimum_keep` safety floor for backups** - Ensure critical recent backups are never deleted regardless of age (default: 3). Protects infrequent users from over-cleanup
- **Extended `aligntrue backup cleanup --legacy`** - New command to remove old backup locations (`.aligntrue/overwritten-rules/`, agent-specific `overwritten-files/`) and scattered `.bak` files from pre-unified era
- **Content mode configuration for single-file exports** - New `content_mode` option in sync config to control how single-file exporters (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) handle rule content. Options: `auto` (inline for 1 rule, links for 2+), `inline` (embed all content), `links` (always use markdown links). CLI flag `--content-mode` overrides config. Size warning emitted for inline content exceeding 50KB
- **Structure preservation for rule imports** - Directory structure preserved when importing rules from remote or local sources. Subdirectories maintained during import (e.g., `backend/security.md` stays `backend/security.md` in `.aligntrue/rules/`)
- **Unified source resolver** - Consolidated source handling for local, git, and URL sources. Recursive scanning of directories for `.md` and `.mdc` files during import, with automatic `.mdc` to `.md` format conversion

### Changed

- **Renamed CLI command `adapters` → `exporters`** - Better aligns with user mental model ("exporters" = formats that export to agents). Config field `exporters:` remains unchanged. CLI help moved from "Development commands" to "Basic commands". Old `/adapters` URL redirects to `/exporters`
- **Bulk search and replace `adapter(s)` → `exporter(s)`** to reduce confusio and increase consistency.
- **BREAKING: `resolveSource()` from `@aligntrue/core` no longer supports git sources** - Git source resolution moved from `@aligntrue/core` to `@aligntrue/cli` to eliminate the `new Function()` dynamic import that triggered security scanner warnings. Use CLI commands (`aligntrue add`, `aligntrue sync`) for git sources. Core now throws a clear error for git sources, directing users to use CLI
- **Case-insensitive section heading selectors** - Overlay selectors using `sections[heading=...]` now match case-insensitively for better UX. `sections[heading=Security]` matches "security", "SECURITY", or "Security"
- **Agent files included in backups** - Sync and manual backups now include agent export files (AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules/\*.mdc, etc.) based on configured exporters. Ensures complete restore capability
- **New file backup before overwrite** - When syncing to a new agent file that already has content, the original file is backed up before overwriting
- **BREAKING: Plain HTTP/HTTPS URLs no longer supported for remote rules** - Use git repositories instead (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, SSH, self-hosted). Plain URLs lacked directory listing capabilities. Migrate by changing `https://example.com/rules.yaml` to `https://github.com/org/rules` for full git support
- **BREAKING: Backup configuration schema** - `keep_count` deprecated in favor of `retention_days` + `minimum_keep`. Old configs still work (graceful migration); new installs get age-based retention
- **Individual file backup location** - All overwritten file backups now under `.aligntrue/.backups/files/` instead of scattered `overwritten-rules/` and `overwritten-files/` directories
- **Backup filename format** - Individual file backups now include `.bak` suffix (e.g., `AGENTS.2025-11-29T12-30-00.md.bak`) for improved clarity at a glance
- **`sources split` backup mechanism** - Now uses unified backup system instead of inline `AGENTS.md.bak` in project root
- **Backup cleanup algorithm** - Switched from count-based to age-based with safety floor. Auto-cleanup after sync respects `retention_days` and `minimum_keep` from config

### Fixed

- **Rules not loading from dot-directories** - Fixed glob pattern in `loadRulesDirectory` not finding rules in directories starting with a dot (e.g., `.cursor/`). Added `dot: true` option to enable matching files in dot-prefixed directories
- **AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md not created during sync** - Fixed exporter failing when frontmatter `globs` field is a string instead of array. Now handles both YAML formats correctly
- **Backup files tracked by git** - Init command now creates `.aligntrue/.gitignore` to ignore internal state files (`.backups/`, `.source-rule-hashes.json`, `.cache/`, etc.)
- **Import flow messaging** - Clarified init and add command messaging. Now shows "Found X rules from [source]" before confirmation instead of confusing "Import complete" followed by "Initialize with X rules?" Also improved error messages to include supported source formats with examples and points to https://aligntrue.ai/sources
- **Scattered backup locations** - Eliminated fragmented backups across project root (`.bak` files), `.aligntrue/overwritten-rules/`, and agent-specific `overwritten-files/` directories
- **Lockfile EISDIR error** - Fixed team mode lockfile generation failing with EISDIR error when `.aligntrue/rules` is a directory. Now uses `loadIR()` which correctly handles directory-based rules
- **Git import path handling** - Fixed `aligntrue add <url> --path .` failing with "path should be a path.relative()d string" error. Repository root imports now work correctly
- **Plugs UX messaging** - Improved `aligntrue plugs list` output to provide helpful guidance when no slots are defined. Detects `[[plug:key]]` references in rules and suggests how to define corresponding slots

### Security

- **ReDoS vulnerability in starter rule comment stripping** - Fixed polynomial regex in `stripStarterRuleComment()` that could cause exponential backtracking on pathological input. Replaced vulnerable `[^]*?` pattern with bounded negative lookahead `(?:(?!-->)[\s\S])*?` to prevent catastrophic backtracking

### Fixed

- **Release process workspace protocol safety** - Fixed critical bug in `scripts/manual-release.mjs` where `npm publish` was used instead of `pnpm publish`, risking workspace protocol leaks in published packages. Added post-publish validation and updated documentation to reflect actual manual release workflow
- **Windows test timeouts** - Fixed exporter tests hanging on Windows CI by simplifying atomic file write implementation. Replaced complex temp directory creation with same-directory temp files and hidden backup files, eliminating EXDEV (cross-device link) errors and mkdtempSync delays on Windows
- **Sync cleanup detection** - Replaced unreliable `--prune` flag with new `--clean` flag that properly detects and removes all stale exported files (files with no matching source rule), not just content-identical duplicates. Dynamically derives multi-file exporter paths instead of hardcoded mapping

### Added

- **Stale export cleanup (`--clean` flag)** - New `aligntrue sync --clean` flag removes exported files that no longer have a corresponding source rule. Sync automatically warns about stale files when detected and suggests running with `--clean` to remove them
- **OpenHands multi-file support** - OpenHands exporter now writes one markdown file per rule to `.openhands/microagents/` instead of a single file, enabling better microagent organization
- **Junie AGENTS.md support** - Junie exporter now delegates to AGENTS.md format for consistency with other link-based agents
- **Goose AGENTS.md support** - Goose exporter now delegates to AGENTS.md format instead of custom `.goosehints` format
- **Per-exporter ignore file toggle** - New `ignore_file` option in exporter config allows disabling ignore file generation per agent (e.g., `exporters.cursor: {ignore_file: false}`)
- **.alignignore file support** - New `.alignignore` file prevents AlignTrue from editing, deleting, or overwriting specified files using gitignore-style patterns

- **MCP server configuration propagation** - MCP exporters now read from centralized `config.mcp.servers` and propagate to agent-specific MCP files (.vscode/mcp.json, .cursor/mcp.json, .mcp.json, etc.) with deterministic hashing
- **Align manifest system (.align.yaml)** - New manifest format for curated bundles with includes, customizations, and defaults for easy sharing
- **URL source support (type: url)** - Fetch rules directly from HTTP/HTTPS endpoints with ETag caching and offline fallback
- **Align add/remove CLI commands** - New commands to add/remove align sources from configuration (`aligntrue add <url>`, `aligntrue remove <url>`)
- **Manifest loading utilities** - Core functions for loading manifests, applying customizations, parsing align URLs with query parameters
- **enabled field in rule frontmatter** - Non-destructive way to disable rules without deleting them (default: true if not present)
- **Plugs and overlays conventions reference** - New documentation guide with recommended plug keys (test.cmd, docs.url, org.name, etc.) and overlay patterns to improve ecosystem interoperability
- **Example aligns with plugs** - Updated `testing.md` and `typescript.md` with plug slots and overlay hints to demonstrate best practices
- **Conventions guidance for align authors** - New section in creating-aligns guide encouraging use of standard plug keys for better user experience
- **Simplified source configuration with `include` syntax** - New `include` array field allows multiple files per git source without repetition. Format: `https://github.com/org/repo[@ref][/path]` with smart defaults (no path = all .md in root, path ending with `/` = directory, `@ref` = version pin)
- **First-wins merge precedence** - Rules now merge with local rules always highest priority, then external sources in order listed. First source wins on conflict (changed from last-wins for better UX)
- **Sync summary output** - `aligntrue sync` now displays source precedence list showing all included sources and their priority order
- **URL parser for git sources** - New `parseSourceURL()` utility for parsing fully-qualified git URLs with embedded refs and paths
- **Multi-source reliability tests** - Integration tests for first-wins precedence, source ordering, include syntax validation, and add/remove source workflows
- **Managing rule sources guide** - New comprehensive documentation page with examples, troubleshooting, and best practices for external sources
- **Onboarding sources link** - Added "Add external rules" checklist item with link to `aligntrue.ai/sources` in onboard command
- **Source error formatting** - Clear error messages with "did you mean?" suggestions and available files listing for source-related errors

### Changed

- **Plugs API consistency** - Changed plugs resolution result from `guidance` to `content` field to align with canonical schema
- **Bundle merge logic** - Changed from last-wins to first-wins precedence for better predictability and local-first workflow
- **Git sources documentation** - Updated to show new `include` syntax with examples (backward compatible with old `url`/`path` format)
- **Architecture documentation** - Updated to explain first-wins precedence and source priority order
- **Pack terminology to align** - Renamed "pack" concept to "align" throughout codebase and documentation for clarity

### Fixed

- **Git source sync** - Fixed `Unsupported file format` error when syncing from git sources by using temporary bundle file instead of trying to write to `.aligntrue/rules` directory for non-local sources
- **Command coverage test** - Removed non-existent "update" command from test list to prevent CI failure
- **Git source test** - Fixed assertion logic to properly check sync output for completion messages

### Removed (Cleanup of Deprecated Features)

**Cleanup of bidirectional sync artifacts** - Removed dead code and non-functional features left from earlier architecture:

- **Team-managed sections infrastructure** - Config schema, renderers, and tests for marking sections `[TEAM-MANAGED]`
- **Section merger and bidirectional logic** - `file-merger.ts`, `section-matcher.ts` for merging user edits from agent files
- **Scope prefixing option** (`sync.scope_prefixing`) - Unused configuration for scope prefixes in exports
- **Update command and allow list** - Deprecated `aligntrue update check/apply` and `.aligntrue/allow.yaml` infrastructure (use git PR review instead)
- **Section extraction utility** (`extract-rules.ts`) - Dead code for drift detection from agent file edits
- **recommendEditSource function** - Edit source recommendation for bidirectional sync
- **Skipped and placeholder tests** - Removed obsolete test stubs for bidirectional workflows

**Impact:** ~1000-1500 lines of code removed, simpler codebase, cleaner mental model for unidirectional sync

### BREAKING CHANGES

**Fundamental architectural shift to Ruler-style unidirectional sync**

This release introduces a complete architectural refactor. The complex bidirectional sync system has been replaced with a simple, reliable unidirectional model: `.aligntrue/rules/*.md` files are the single source of truth, with exports flowing outward to agent-specific formats.

**Migration:** Run `aligntrue init` in existing projects to import rules from agent files into `.aligntrue/rules/`. Review and deduplicate imported rules as needed.

- **New canonical IR format:** `.aligntrue/rules/*.md` (markdown with YAML frontmatter) replaces `.aligntrue/.rules.yaml`
- **Removed:** `sync.edit_source` config option and all related configuration
- **Removed:** `sync.auto_pull`, `sync.primary_agent`, `sync.on_conflict`, `sync.workflow_mode`, `sync.show_diff_on_pull` config options
- **Removed:** Agent pullback (`--accept-agent` flag and related logic)
- **Removed:** Edit source switching prompts and logic
- **Removed:** Bidirectional sync capabilities
- **New init behavior:** Automatically scans for and imports existing agent rules into `.aligntrue/rules/`
- **New export format:** Single-file agents (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) now use links to rule files instead of concatenated content
- **New frontmatter:** Comprehensive schema with export controls (`exclude_from`, `export_only_to`) and agent-specific metadata blocks

**Why this change:**

- Simpler mental model: edit rules in one place, export everywhere
- More reliable: eliminates complex merge strategies and conflict resolution
- Better organization: one rule per file with clear frontmatter
- Export controls: fine-grained control over which rules export to which agents
- Link-based exports: proven to work better than concatenated files

### Added

- **Frontmatter schema:** Comprehensive YAML frontmatter for rule files with selection mechanisms (scope, globs, apply_to) and export controls (exclude_from, export_only_to)
- **Rule file parser/writer:** New utilities in `@aligntrue/core` for loading and saving `.aligntrue/rules/*.md` files
- **Nested directory support:** Auto-detects nested `.aligntrue/rules/` directories and mirrors structure to agent exports
- **Rule import:** `aligntrue init` now scans for existing Cursor, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and other agent files and imports them
- **Starter templates:** If no existing rules found during init, creates practical starter rules (global, typescript, testing, documentation, debugging)
- **Export controls:** `exclude_from` and `export_only_to` frontmatter fields for fine-grained export control
- **Link-based exports:** Single-file agents (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) now contain links to rule files instead of concatenated content

### Removed

- `packages/cli/src/utils/edit-source-content-merger.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/utils/edit-source-agent-mapping.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/utils/edit-source.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/utils/edit-source-helpers.ts`
- `packages/core/src/config/edit-source-patterns.ts`
- `packages/core/src/utils/edit-source-matcher.ts`
- `packages/core/src/sync/agent-pullback.ts`
- All edit source tests

### Fixed

- **CodeQL security alerts** - Fixed insecure temporary file creation (HIGH severity) by using cryptographic randomness for temp directory names and ensuring proper cleanup; fixed shell command injection vulnerability (MEDIUM severity) in test utilities by safely quoting shell arguments
- **Drift detection reliability** - Replaced timestamp-based agent file drift detection with content hash comparison for deterministic, cross-platform reliability. This fixes intermittent CI failures and handles copy/paste workflows correctly.
- **CodeQL alert (useless assignment)** - Removed unused initialization of `exportResults` variable in sync engine
- **Golden repo test flakiness** - Added error handling and debug logging to improve test stability in CI environment
- **Stuck spinner in sync command** - Fixed an issue where the "Resolving sources" spinner continued running during interactive prompts in non-verbose mode
- Confusing pluralization in init completion message - Message now uses singular "agent" when only 1 exporter is configured, plural "agents" for multiple exporters
- Duplicate message when switching edit source - Removed redundant "Edit source updated" message that appeared before merge strategy prompt during `aligntrue sync`
- Confusing UI in merge strategy prompt - Simplified option labels and hints to eliminate double parentheses and improve clarity
- Silent error handling in drift detection - Added debug logging for allow list parsing failures
- Restored test coverage by fixing skipped tests - Updated 5 sync command tests to use current IR schema format
- Test IR format updated - Fixed tests using deprecated `rules` array format to use `sections` format

### Improved

- Config validation enhancements - Added warnings for incompatible mode/lockfile combinations (solo+lockfile or team without lockfile)
- Refactored check command for maintainability - Extracted file size validation into separate helper module
- Added refactoring strategy documentation - Documented incremental refactoring approach for large SyncEngine class
- **API Improvements for Plugin Developers**
  - Added optional `resetState()` method to `ExporterPlugin` interface in `@aligntrue/plugin-contracts`
  - Allows exporters to clear internal state (like warning counters) between sync runs
  - Fully backward compatible (optional method)
  - Cleaned up internal type assertions in core engine

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Simplified Edit Source Switching**
  - When switching edit sources (e.g., AGENTS.md → Cursor), AlignTrue now treats the **new source as the truth** instead of merging content.
  - **New behavior:**
    1. Old source files are backed up to `.aligntrue/overwritten-rules/` and deleted from workspace.
    2. Content from new source replaces the internal rules (IR).
    3. Sync runs immediately to update all exporters with the new rules.
  - **Removed:** `editSourceMergeStrategy` option and prompts (keep-both/keep-new/keep-existing).
  - **Migration:** Users who relied on merging content during a switch can manually recover sections from the backup file.
- **Unified rule loading configuration** - `sync.source_files` option has been **removed**. The `sync.edit_source` option now controls BOTH file monitoring (for edits) AND content loading.
  - Glob patterns in `edit_source` (e.g. `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) now automatically trigger multi-file rule loading
  - Single file patterns (e.g. `AGENTS.md`) continue to work as single edit sources
  - This eliminates the common configuration error where rules were watched but not loaded
- **Edit source patterns now centralized** - Single source of truth for exporter-to-pattern mappings in `@aligntrue/core/config/edit-source-patterns`
- **Removed IR-only edit source option** - `edit_source: ".rules.yaml"` is no longer supported (use human-friendly `.aligntrue/rules/*.md` instead)
- **Added support for multi-file markdown organization** - New recommended option `edit_source: ".aligntrue/rules/*.md"` for teams
- **Deprecated `sync.two_way` config option** - Use `edit_source` and `centralized` settings instead
- **Updated messaging** - Clarified distinction between IR file (`.aligntrue/.rules.yaml`, canonical) and edit source options
- **Node.js requirement:** Reduced from Node 22 to Node 20 for broader adoption
  - Node 20 LTS supported until April 2026
  - All packages now require Node >=20
  - CI validates both Node 20 and Node 22 compatibility
  - Updated `.node-version` to 20.18.1

### Fixed

- File-system race conditions (TOCTOU) in agent detection and ignore file handling
  - Removed pre-checks before file reads; rely on try/catch for error handling
  - Prevents malicious or concurrent deletion between check and operation
  - Resolves CodeQL alerts #258-262
- Incomplete sanitization of glob patterns in edit source detection
  - Added proper regex escaping for all special characters before glob-to-regex conversion
  - Resolves CodeQL alert #260
- Unused import in eslint.config.js excluded from linting
  - Resolves CodeQL alert #259

### Added

- ESLint rule `no-check-then-operate` to prevent TOCTOU race conditions at development time
- Three new security-focused ESLint rules to catch issues before CodeQL:
  - `no-math-random`: Flags Math.random() in production code (use crypto instead)
  - `no-env-var-in-output`: Flags process.env in console output (prevent leaks)
  - `no-hardcoded-secrets`: Flags suspected API keys, passwords, tokens in strings
- Checksum-based overwrite protection for exported files using `AtomicFileWriter`
- Interactive conflict resolution prompts during sync when files have been manually edited
- `--force` flag now also bypasses file overwrite protection for non-interactive syncs

### Added

- Agent ignore file management to prevent duplicate context when multiple exporters target formats consumable by same agent
- Automatic detection of format conflicts during init and sync
- Support for 12 agent-specific ignore files (Cursor, Aider, Gemini, Crush, Warp, Cline, Goose, Junie, Augment Code, Kiro, KiloCode, Firebase Studio)
- Nested ignore file support for scoped exports in monorepos
- Config options: `sync.auto_manage_ignore_files`, `sync.ignore_file_priority`, `sync.custom_format_priority`
- Documentation: Preventing duplicate rules guide
- Documentation: Comprehensive CI/automation guide with `--yes` and `--non-interactive` flags
- Documentation: Enhanced CLI reference with non-interactive mode examples for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins

## [0.2.2] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed

- Published packages no longer contain workspace protocol in dependencies
- Added ui package to release script to prevent version drift
- Implemented two-layer validation to catch workspace protocol leaks
- Fixed unresolved plugs warning when fills are properly configured in config.yaml

### Changed

- Release script now uses pnpm publish instead of npm publish for automatic workspace protocol rewriting

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-19

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Backups are now mandatory and cannot be disabled
- **BREAKING**: Removed `backup.auto_backup` config option (backups always enabled)
- **BREAKING**: Removed `backup.backup_on` config option (all destructive operations backed up)
- **BREAKING**: Removed `sync.backup_on_overwrite` and `sync.backup_extension` (no more inline .bak files)
- Simplified backup config to single `backup.keep_count` setting (min: 10, default: 20, max: 100)
- All backups now consolidated in `.aligntrue/.backups/` with timestamp organization
- Enhanced CLI messaging to emphasize safety best practices (dry-run, revert, restore)
- Backup timestamps now include process ID and sequence number for guaranteed uniqueness during concurrent operations

### Added

- `aligntrue backup cleanup --legacy` command to remove orphaned .bak files from older versions
- Comprehensive safety best practices documentation in guides
- Clear backup creation and restore messages in CLI output
- Validation for keep_count range with actionable error messages
- Plugs: Config-based fills support via `plugs.fills` in config.yaml

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-18

### Added

- Workspace protocol validation (`pnpm validate:workspace`) to ensure all internal packages depend on each other via `workspace:*`
- Pre-publish validation script (`pnpm prepublish:check`) that enforces clean git state, matching versions, workspace compliance, and runs build/typecheck/tests before publishing

### Changed

- Renamed the `agents-md` format to `agents` across schema, core, exporters, and CLI
- All `@aligntrue/*` packages now reference each other via `workspace:*` so local development always prefers live workspace builds

### Fixed

- Type resolution in CI now uses local workspace packages instead of stale npm cache artifacts, preventing `TS2322` regressions when format names change

### Removed

- Removed unused v2 error handling system (common-errors-v2.ts, error-formatter-v2.ts)
- Deleted the deprecated `@aligntrue/ui/nextra` theme factory and CLI multi-agent import stub; docs now reference the standard `apps/docs/theme.config.tsx` flow.

### Fixed

- Git source configuration now matches the reorganized `AlignTrue/examples` repository (`aligns/` subdirectory). Added playbook troubleshooting guidance, updated docs, and verified end-to-end via manual sync to prevent "Rules file not found" errors.
- Drift command human-readable output no longer truncates details; summaries now include lockfile path, total findings, and tips for `--json` / `--gates`.
- `aligntrue plugs --help` now shows the subcommand list instead of failing with a circular error, and subcommands respect the standard `--help` flag.
- Invalid flags are now rejected with clear error messages instead of being silently accepted
- Fixed duplicate warning messages when solo mode has team features enabled
- Security: Use secure temp directory for backup files to prevent information disclosure and symlink attacks (CodeQL alert `js/insecure-temporary-file`)
- Security: Bump `apps/docs` `mermaid` dependency to `11.12.1` so DOMPurify is 3.3.0+, avoiding the SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES mXSS vulnerability that affected versions before 3.2.4
- Documentation accuracy: Corrected Node.js requirement from 20+ to 22+, removed references to unimplemented commands (pull, md lint/compile), updated CLI command count from 27 to 20, fixed IR file path in architecture docs, and aligned performance benchmark documentation with actual measurements
- Golden repository test validation now matches current exporter behavior (content hash computed and returned, not written as footer)
- UI package test timeouts on Windows by increasing Vitest timeout thresholds to 30s for test and hook execution
- Documentation discrepancy: Clarified that exported files (`.mdc`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) contain clean rule content without footers; content hash and fidelity notes are returned in `ExportResult` and displayed in CLI output instead
- CI test failures due to performance test thresholds and timeouts being too strict. Increased:
  - `--help` performance test thresholds: 800ms → 1200ms avg (Ubuntu), 1000ms → 1500ms max (Ubuntu); 1200ms → 2000ms avg, 1500ms → 2500ms max (Windows)
  - IR loader large file test timeouts: 30s → 120s for 11MB files, 30s → 60s for 2MB files
  - Git strategy detection test timeout: 5s → 15s for git initialization operations

### Added

### Changed

- Simplified exporter names by removing the `-md` suffix: `claude-md`, `agents-md`, `aider-md`, `crush-md`, `gemini-md`, `opencode-md`, `roocode-md`, `warp-md`, `windsurf-md`, and `zed-md` are now `claude`, `agents`, `aider`, `crush`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `roocode`, `warp`, `windsurf`, and `zed`. Update `.aligntrue/config.yaml` exporter lists accordingly.
- Exporter UX improvements: `aligntrue adapters` and `aligntrue status` now link to the full supported agent list and the adapter extension guide whenever they suggest enabling new adapters.
- Spinners now respect terminal capabilities via a shared helper: TTY environments keep the animated output, while non-TTY (CI/log capture) falls back to plain text without ANSI sequences.
- CLI TTY detection now lives in `tty-helper.ts`, removing duplicate helpers from `command-utilities.ts`; `team`/`init` commands and `syncFromAgent` have clearer logging and no longer rely on deprecated annotations.
- `aligntrue check --ci` and `aligntrue drift --gates` help text now cross-reference one another, matching the new command comparison guide.
- Documentation and testing resources referencing `AlignTrue/examples` now use `aligns/<name>.md` paths, matching the reorganized public repository structure.
- **Init no longer overwrites existing agent files**
  - Detects all existing supported agent formats and merges them into `.aligntrue/.rules.yaml` during `aligntrue init`
  - Only creates a new `AGENTS.md` starter when no agent files are found (or when the user explicitly asks for one)
  - Prompts for manual import paths when detection misses a markdown or Cursor file, with clear errors if parsing fails
  - Asks the user whether to run `aligntrue sync` immediately after initialization instead of auto-syncing silently

- **Improved CLI user experience** - Enhanced help text and error messages for better discoverability
  - Suppressed confusing "Invalid IR align" warnings during normal sync operations (validation still occurs at parse time and before export)
  - Enhanced `override add` command help with clear examples showing section-based selectors
  - Improved error messages for invalid selectors with concrete examples
  - Added helpful error for `sources add` command directing users to `pull` command
  - Updated `sources` help text to clarify purpose (multi-file organization vs align addition)
