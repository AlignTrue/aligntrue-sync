# Documentation standards

**When to apply:** Any time you create or update docs, complete features, or touch temporary files. This keeps docs useful and prevents cruft.

## Core principle

**CHANGELOG + user docs are enough.**  
Anything else is temporary. Delete it before merge.

**Self-documenting.**
The user docs should reflect and describe the codebase to users, the code is the authoritative source.

**Optimize for user experience and understandability**

- Keep docs usable and easy to navigate.
- Don't unecessary duplicate things, instead link to the areas needed.
- Use mermaid diagrams to help explain complex things
- WHen it makes sense, organize things into guides or concepts, with other areas linking to them as needed.

---

## Strict rules

### Never create verbose summary docs

Do **not** add:

- `*_SUMMARY.md`
- `*_STATUS.md`
- `*_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- `*_REVIEW.md`
- `docs/development/*-summary.md`
- `docs/development/*-improvements.md`
- Any file that just restates your response or PR description

If it reads like a status, recap, or phase log, it is temporary.

### Only create

1. **`CHANGELOG.md` entries**
2. **User docs in `apps/docs/content/`**  
   Only when users need to understand how to use a feature.
3. **Auto-generated repo files** - `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `SECURITY.md` are generated from docs site via `pnpm generate:repo-files` (see "Documentation architecture" for details).

Internal working notes belong in `.internal_docs/` while work is active. They must not appear in public docs.

---

## CHANGELOG (required)

`CHANGELOG.md` is the single source of truth for changes.

### Standards

- Follow Keep a Changelog style.
- Follow Semantic Versioning.
- Use an `Unreleased` section.
- Reverse chronological order.

### Valid categories

- Added
- Changed
- Deprecated
- Removed
- Fixed
- Security

### Entry format

Keep it short, user facing, and factual.

```markdown
### Added

- Cursor exporter with content hash footer
- CLI command `aligntrue sync` to export to configured agents
```

### Forbidden in CHANGELOG

Do not include:

- Token or effort estimates
- LOC counts
- Full file path lists (config exceptions allowed)
- Test counts or coverage metrics
- Session or phase breakdowns
- Internal refactor detail
- Commit hashes or history dumps
- Build or CI trivia with no user impact

### Allowed

You may include:

- Feature summaries
- Behavior changes
- CLI commands and flags
- Breaking changes and migrations
- Determinism, hashing, or lockfile behavior changes
- Security fixes and CVE references
- Performance improvements with user impact

### Writing style

**Tone:**

- Neutral, factual, concise
- One idea per bullet
- Sentences under 25 words
- No emojis
- No semicolons or em dashes

**Use verbs like:**

- added
- changed
- fixed
- improved
- removed
- updated

**Avoid:**

- Hype and marketing language
- Superlatives
- Second person in technical notes

**Good example:**

```markdown
### Added

- Cursor exporter with fidelity notes footer
```

**Bad example:**

```markdown
### Added

- Amazing new exporter that unlocks next level productivity
```

---

## Commit messages

### Format

```
type(scope): description
```

### Rules

- Present tense
- Lowercase after prefix
- No trailing period

### Examples

```
feat(exporter): add Cursor exporter with content hash footer
fix(schema): handle missing profile id in config
```

---

## Documentation content

Use documentation for real user workflows only.

### User guides

- **Location:** `apps/docs/content/concepts/` or `apps/docs/content/reference/`
- **Create only when:** a feature needs explanation
- **Include:** Overview, Quick start, Configuration, Examples, Troubleshooting
- **Keep examples:** runnable and minimal

### Tone

- Explain what the feature does
- Explain how to use it
- No hype language

### Brand and naming

- **AlignTrue** (no space)
- `.aligntrue/config.yaml` for config
- `.aligntrue/rules` for internal IR
- `.aligntrue.lock.json` and `.aligntrue.bundle.yaml` for team mode
- `.cursor/*.mdc` for Cursor exports
- `.aligntrue/rules/*.md` is the single source of truth (edit here, sync flows to agents)

### Emoji Usage

**NEVER use emojis in:**

- AGENTS.md and agent-exported files
- Rules directory (.aligntrue/rules/)
- Config files (.aligntrue/config.yaml)
- HTML comments and markers in exported files
- Section headings or content that syncs across agents
- Read-only file warnings
- Error messages in synced content

**Reason:** Emojis break parsing, render inconsistently across formats and terminals, cause encoding issues, and reduce clarity in technical content.

**OK to use emojis in:**

- Documentation website (apps/docs) for visual appeal
- README files that are not synced
- Commit messages (for personal preference)
- Internal tools output (CLI help text, status messages)

---

## Documentation site layout

Nextra docs live in `apps/docs/content/`. Browse the directory to see current sections and structure.

### Documentation architecture

AlignTrue uses a **docs-first architecture** where the documentation site is the canonical source and repo root files are generated from it.

**Data flow:**

```
apps/docs/content/ (canonical source - edit here)
  ↓
scripts/generate-repo-files.mjs (transformation)
  ↓
README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, SECURITY.md (generated - don't edit)
```

**File mappings:**

- `apps/docs/content/index.mdx` → `README.md`
- `apps/docs/content/07-contributing/creating-packs.md` → `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `apps/docs/content/06-development/*.md` → `DEVELOPMENT.md` (concatenated)
- `apps/docs/content/07-policies/security.md` → `SECURITY.md`

**Workflow:**

1. Edit docs source in `apps/docs/content/`
2. Stage your changes (including any accidental edits to protected files)
3. Commit—the pre-commit hook will auto-regenerate protected files from source

**Protection:**
The pre-commit hook automatically regenerates protected files when docs source changes. If regeneration fails, the hook explains how to debug.

### Frontmatter

Each page must have:

```yaml
---
description: One line description
---
```

### Guidelines

- Use relative links
- Use `bash`, `yaml`, `typescript` tags for code blocks
- Keep navigation shallow and obvious
- Use callouts and tabs only when they improve clarity
- Avoid custom React components in content

### Markdown (.md) vs MDX (.mdx)

**Use `.md` (default)**

- Pure markdown content
- No JSX components
- Works fine with Nextra
- Most docs should be `.md`

**Use `.mdx` when adding JSX**

- `<Callout>` components
- `<Tabs>` components
- `<Cards>` components
- Any other React/JSX elements
- **Critical:** Rename `.md` → `.mdx` BEFORE adding JSX, otherwise components won't render

**Naming convention:**
When you add a JSX component to an existing `.md` file, rename it to `.mdx` in the same edit. Example:

```bash
git mv overlays.md overlays.mdx
# Then add <Callout> components
```

**Generation compatibility:**
The `pnpm generate:repo-files` script handles both `.md` and `.mdx` files equally, so this doesn't affect README generation.

---

## Small vs big changes

### Small feature or fix

**Scope:** one module or limited files.

**Do:**

- Add 1 to 3 bullets to `CHANGELOG.md`
- Update existing docs only if behavior changed

**Do not:**

- Create new pages
- Add status or summary docs

### Big feature or system

**Scope:** new feature set or architecture.

**Do:**

- Add 3 to 5 bullets to `CHANGELOG.md`
- Add one focused doc page in concepts or reference
- Explain enablement, config, and key workflows

**Do not:**

- Add multi page status narratives
- Keep phase or session logs

---

## Cleanup and completion

### Temporary files to delete

Delete before merge:

- `*_STATUS.md`, `*_CHECKLIST.md`, `*_SUMMARY.md`
- `*_PHASE*.md`, `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `*_COMPLETE.md`, `*_FILES_CREATED.txt`
- Any `*.md` with `UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORES` used as working notes
- Notes under `dev/` (keep `.internal_docs/*.md` for internal planning only)

### Permanent files to keep

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `apps/docs/content/**/*.md`
- `.internal_docs/*.md` (internal only, never linked from public docs)

### Before merge checklist

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Create or update user docs if feature is user facing
3. Delete all temporary files listed above
4. Confirm git is clean (`git status`)

### Do not claim completion if

- Temporary `*_*.md` files remain
- Docs are missing for new user facing behavior

---

## Package Exports Documentation

**Critical requirement:** All package exports must be documented BEFORE adding to `package.json`.

### Documentation location

`apps/docs/content/06-development/package-exports.md`

### Required information

For each export, document:

- Export path (e.g., `./utils/section-parser`)
- Purpose (one sentence description)
- Example usage (import statement)

### Workflow

1. **Document first** - Add entry to package exports documentation
2. **Add export** - Update `exports` field in `package.json`
3. **Build and test** - Verify: `pnpm build && pnpm test`
4. **Update CHANGELOG** - Add entry describing the new export

### Export format

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "./your-export": {
      "types": "./dist/your-export.d.ts",
      "default": "./dist/your-export.js"
    }
  }
}
```

### Why this matters

- Prevents accidental exposure of internal APIs
- Ensures all exports are intentional and documented
- Enables CI validation of exports
- Provides clear guidance for package consumers

### Validation

CI should validate that:

- All exports in `package.json` are documented
- All documented exports exist in `package.json`
- All export files exist in `dist/` after build

---

## Documentation accuracy validation

**Critical requirement:** Documentation must match implementation reality. Code and config are the source of truth, not docs.

### Automated validation

CI and pre-commit hooks automatically validate:

1. **Node.js version requirements**
   - Source of truth: `package.json` engines.node field
   - Validated in: All documentation files mentioning Node version
   - Update trigger: When changing `package.json` engines field

2. **CLI command count**
   - Source of truth: `packages/cli/src/index.ts` command dispatch statements
   - Validated in: `apps/docs/content/04-reference/features.md`
   - Update trigger: When adding/removing CLI commands

3. **Exporter count**
   - Source of truth: Directory count in `packages/exporters/src/`
   - Validated in: `apps/docs/content/index.mdx`, `apps/docs/content/04-reference/agent-support.md`
   - Update trigger: When adding/removing exporters

4. **Performance threshold claims**
   - Source of truth: `packages/cli/tests/integration/performance.test.ts` threshold constants
   - Validated in: `apps/docs/content/04-reference/features.md`
   - Update trigger: When changing test thresholds

### Running validation manually

```bash
pnpm validate:docs
```

### When validation fails

1. Read the error message - it shows expected vs actual values
2. Update documentation to match code/config (not the other way around)
3. Re-run validation to confirm fix
4. Commit both code and doc changes together

### What is NOT validated

Validation only covers quantifiable claims. These still require manual updates:

- Feature descriptions and explanations
- Usage examples and tutorials
- Troubleshooting guides
- Conceptual documentation
- Qualitative performance claims

For these, follow the existing rules: update docs when behavior changes.
