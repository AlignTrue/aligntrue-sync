# Rules authoring guide

## Purpose

Use this when creating or updating any Cursor rule so guidance stays sharp, consistent, and testable.

---

## Output contract when proposing a rule change

Every proposed rule or edit must include:

1. Summary of change
2. Rationale
3. Updated rule text only
4. Impacted areas and precedence notes
5. Tests or examples if relevant
6. Conflict check: rules it supersedes, extends, or defers to

---

## Authoring checklist

- Write for the agent in imperative voice
- One topic per rule; split large topics
- Keep each rule under 500 lines
- State where it applies and where it does not
- Lead with hard constraints (must, never, only)
- Add at least one minimal example for each key directive
- Encode precedence when overlap is possible
- Reference real context with `@Cursor Rules`, `@Docs`, and file paths
- For response shaping rules, define an explicit output contract
- Prefer paved road patterns over generic prohibitions
- Ban known anti patterns directly with short examples
- Keep diffs minimal; avoid full rewrites without cause

---

## Rule structure

Each rule must follow this shape:

1. **Header**
   - `id`, `version`, `updated`, `owner`, `status`
2. **Title**
   - Short, specific topic name
3. **When this applies**
   - Repo paths, tech stack, scenarios
4. **Constraints**
   - Explicit must, never, only
5. **Patterns**
   - Preferred approaches and paved road flows
6. **Output contract**
   - Required sections for agent replies
7. **References**
   - `@Cursor Rules`, `@Docs`, files in repo
8. **Examples**
   - One good, one bad
9. **Precedence**
   - Which rules it overrides or defers to

---

## Quality bar

Rules must be:

- Clear, concrete, and testable
- Short sentences, minimal jargon
- Free of duplicated guidance across rules

If guidance is duplicated, extract it into one rule and reference it.

---

## Maintenance

- Update rules in the same PR as relevant architectural or workflow changes
- Remove obsolete text instead of stacking exceptions
- Use small, focused diffs
- Treat rules as code: review, test, and version them

---

## Do not

- Do not embed team philosophy or broad narrative
- Do not use vague terms like "clean" or "simple" without criteria
- Do not reference docs generically; use explicit `@` links or file paths
