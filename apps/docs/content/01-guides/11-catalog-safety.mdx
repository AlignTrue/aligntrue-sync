description: How to safely use Align catalog items and report issues

# Catalog safety

The Align catalog is community-submitted content. Treat it like GitHub: review before you run or install.

## What we validate

- GitHub-only sources: blob/tree URLs are required.
- File types: `.md`, `.mdc`, `.mdx`, `.markdown`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, plus agent files like `.clinerules`, `.cursorrules`, `.goosehints`.
- Size caps: 256 KB for single files; packs are limited to 100 files, 500 KB per file, and 2 MB total.
- Cache and resilience: cached copies are used when sources fail or disappear.
- Content hashes: detail pages warn when fetched content differs from the submitted version.

## What you should do

- Read the rule or pack before installing.
- Prefer pinned refs (tag/commit) when sharing links.
- Re-check content if the detail page shows a content-changed warning.

## Report problems

If you find malicious, misleading, or spam content, open a GitHub issue using the "Report" link on the catalog card or detail page. Include the Align ID and URL so we can act quickly.
