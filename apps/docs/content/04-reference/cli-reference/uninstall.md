# Uninstall

Remove AlignTrue from a project with options to convert or delete exported files.

## Overview

The `aligntrue uninstall` command provides a clean way to remove AlignTrue from a project. It offers interactive prompts for what to keep or remove, and always creates a safety backup before making changes.

## Usage

```bash
aligntrue uninstall [options]
```

## Options

| Option                    | Description                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--dry-run`               | Preview changes without making them                    |
| `--non-interactive`, `-y` | Run without prompts (use with export/source flags)     |
| `--convert-exports`       | Convert exports to editable (remove READ-ONLY markers) |
| `--delete-exports`        | Delete all exported agent files                        |
| `--keep-exports`          | Keep exports as-is (skip)                              |
| `--delete-source`         | Delete `.aligntrue/` directory                         |
| `--keep-source`           | Keep `.aligntrue/` directory                           |
| `--help`                  | Show help message                                      |

## Interactive mode

By default, `aligntrue uninstall` runs interactively, guiding you through the removal process:

```bash
aligntrue uninstall
```

You'll be prompted to choose:

1. **What to do with exported agent files:**
   - **Convert to editable** (recommended): Removes READ-ONLY markers so you can continue editing files manually
   - **Delete completely**: Removes all exported files
   - **Skip**: Leaves files as-is with READ-ONLY markers

2. **What to do with source rules:**
   - **Keep** (recommended): Preserves your `.aligntrue/` directory for future reference
   - **Delete**: Removes the entire `.aligntrue/` directory

A preview is shown before confirming any changes.

## Non-interactive mode

For scripts and CI, use the `-y` flag with explicit export/source flags:

```bash
# Convert exports to editable, keep source rules
aligntrue uninstall -y --convert-exports --keep-source

# Full removal - delete everything
aligntrue uninstall -y --delete-exports --delete-source

# Preview without changes
aligntrue uninstall --dry-run -y --convert-exports
```

### Defaults in non-interactive mode

When using `-y` without specifying flags:

- Exports: `--convert-exports` (default)
- Source: `--keep-source` (default)

## What gets removed

### Exported agent files

Files created by AlignTrue exporters, which may include:

- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` - Cursor rules
- `AGENTS.md` - Claude, Copilot, Aider rules
- `.clinerules/` - Cline rules
- `.augment/rules/` - AugmentCode rules
- `.openhands/microagents/` - OpenHands rules
- `.mcp.json` - Root MCP configuration
- Various other agent-specific files

### AlignTrue configuration

- `.aligntrue/config.yaml` - Configuration file
- `.aligntrue/rules/` - Source rule files
- `.aligntrue/.cache/` - Git source cache
- `.aligntrue/.backups/` - Local backups (kept for recovery)

### Lockfile

- `.aligntrue/lock.json` - Always deleted if present

### Gitignore entries

AlignTrue-managed sections in `.gitignore` are removed:

- `# START AlignTrue Generated Files` ... `# END AlignTrue Generated Files`
- `# START AlignTrue Gitignored Rules` ... `# END AlignTrue Gitignored Rules`

## READ-ONLY marker conversion

When you choose "Convert to editable", the READ-ONLY marker block is removed from exported files:

**Before:**

```markdown
<!--
  READ-ONLY: This file is auto-generated by AlignTrue.
  DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY. Changes will be overwritten.
  Edit rules in .aligntrue/rules/ instead.
-->

# My rule

Content here...
```

**After:**

```markdown
# My rule

Content here...
```

The content is preserved, only the marker is removed.

## Safety backup

A backup is always created before any changes are made. If something goes wrong, you can restore:

```bash
# List available backups
aligntrue backup list

# Restore the most recent backup
aligntrue backup restore

# Restore a specific backup
aligntrue backup restore --timestamp <backup-id>
```

The backup timestamp is shown in the uninstall output.

## Examples

### Interactive uninstall

```bash
aligntrue uninstall
```

Walks you through the options with a preview before confirming.

### Preview changes

```bash
aligntrue uninstall --dry-run
```

Shows what would be changed without making any modifications.

### CI/scripting: convert and keep source

```bash
aligntrue uninstall -y --convert-exports --keep-source
```

Converts exported files to editable and keeps your source rules.

### Full removal

```bash
aligntrue uninstall -y --delete-exports --delete-source
```

Removes all AlignTrue files and exported agent files.

### Keep everything as-is except cleanup gitignore

```bash
aligntrue uninstall -y --keep-exports --keep-source
```

Only removes gitignore entries and lockfile (if present).

## After uninstalling

After running uninstall:

1. **If you converted exports**: Your agent files are now editable. You can modify them directly without AlignTrue.

2. **If you kept source rules**: Your rules in `.aligntrue/rules/` are still available for reference or manual copying.

3. **Re-installing later**: Run `aligntrue init` to set up AlignTrue again. Your backup is available if you need to restore previous configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot delete files

If uninstall fails to delete some files, check:

- File permissions
- Files open in other applications
- Files locked by version control

You can manually delete remaining files after addressing the issue.

### Want to undo uninstall

Use the backup created during uninstall:

```bash
aligntrue backup restore --timestamp <backup-id>
```

This restores your `.aligntrue/` directory. You'll need to run `aligntrue sync` to regenerate exports.

### Partial uninstall

If uninstall was interrupted, you may have a partial state. Either:

- Run `aligntrue uninstall` again to complete the process
- Restore from backup and start over
