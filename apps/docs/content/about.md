# About AlignTrue

## What

AlignTrue makes it easy to sync rules across AI agents, projects and teams:

- Solo devs: Keeping rules aligned across multiple agents (Cursor .mdc files, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) or multiple projects
- Teams: Keeping rules aligned across team members using different IDEs and agents to enforce best practices and consistency.

It's ([MIT Licensed](LICENSE). I'm trying to make the project largely self-documenting, so if you see any issues in the documentation or otherwise, PRs welcome!

## Who

I'm [Gabe Mays](https://gmays.com/about/) and I like to build things.

## Why

### TL;DR

Shortly before starting the project I went deep with AI agents. I spent billions of tokens in a matter of weeks. This gave me insight into the insane power and capabilities of AI, but also the gaps.

And the biggest gap is failing to guide the AI with rules. And this proved to be much harder than it should have been, so I decided to fix it.

### Diving into AI

I've been investing in AI-related companies and building AI products since early 2023 when I built one of the first AI products at my company.

I also [started studying math daily](https://gmays.com/how-im-relearning-math-as-an-adult/) to understand how AI works. **My streak is at 769 days** as of 11/9/2025. I shared my [500 day update here](https://gmays.com/500-days-of-math/).

### An observation

What's interesting is how some thrive with AI and others struggle to adopt it meaningfully, kind of like the attempt to electrify steam factories in the late 1800's.

I've thought a lot about the blockers to unlock more GDP growth from AI.

A blocker in regulated industries is AI interpretability and explainability, because you can't deploy what you can't explain. I explored that with [GlassAlpha](https://glassalpha.com).

But the bigger problem is that most people and companies just aren't effective at using AI yet.

This is a broad problem and I see massive opportunities to solve it. I'm starting with rules since it seems like the most tractable thing, and have some other things lined up to tackle next.
