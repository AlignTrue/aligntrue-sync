# Concepts

AlignTrue's core concepts explained. Start with the glossary to understand terminology, then explore how sync works, backup strategies, and team collaboration features.

## Quick overview

- **[Glossary](/docs/03-concepts/glossary)** - Essential terminology and definitions used throughout AlignTrue
- **[How sync works](/docs/03-concepts/sync-behavior)** - Understand the core sync mechanism that keeps your rules in sync across agents
- **[Backup](/docs/03-concepts/backup)** - Local and remote backup strategies for your rules
- **[Preventing duplicate rules](/docs/03-concepts/preventing-duplicate-rules)** - Manage multiple exporters without duplicate agent context
- **[Team mode](/docs/03-concepts/team-mode)** - Collaborative rule management with lockfiles and approval workflows (team feature)
- **[Drift detection](/docs/03-concepts/drift-detection)** - Monitor when your rules diverge from approved versions (team feature)
- **[Git workflows](/docs/03-concepts/git-workflows)** - Use git sources, vendoring, and sharing strategies (team feature)

## Learning path

### Solo developers start here:

1. Read [Glossary](/docs/03-concepts/glossary) - learn key terms
2. Review [How sync works](/docs/03-concepts/sync-behavior) - understand the core flow
3. Learn about [Backup](/docs/03-concepts/backup) - protect your work
4. Explore [Preventing duplicate rules](/docs/03-concepts/preventing-duplicate-rules) - optimize agent context

### Teams add these:

5. Understand [Team mode](/docs/03-concepts/team-mode) - enable collaboration
6. Monitor with [Drift detection](/docs/03-concepts/drift-detection) - track alignment
7. Share with [Git workflows](/docs/03-concepts/git-workflows) - manage rule sources
