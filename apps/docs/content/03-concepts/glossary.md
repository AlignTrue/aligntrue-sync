# Glossary

Essential terms and concepts used throughout AlignTrue documentation and CLI.

## Core concepts

### Agents

AI coding assistants that AlignTrue exports rules to. Examples include:

- **Cursor** (.mdc files)
- **GitHub Copilot** (AGENTS.md format)
- **Claude Code** (AGENTS.md + Claude-specific formats)
- **Aider**, **Windsurf**, **VS Code MCP**, and 24+ others

AlignTrue supports **33 agents** through **51 specialized exporters**, each optimized for that agent's native format.

**Related:** [Agent Support](/docs/04-reference/agent-support)

### Rules

Individual guidelines that specify how AI agents should behave in your project. Each rule includes:

- **ID** - Unique identifier (e.g., `require-tests`, `no-any-type`)
- **Severity** - `error`, `warn`, or `info`
- **Applies to** - Glob patterns for which files the rule applies to
- **Guidance** - Human-readable explanation for AI agents
- **Optional:** Checks, autofixes, and vendor-specific metadata

**Example:** "All TypeScript files must have strict mode enabled"

**Related:** [Align Spec](/docs/04-reference/features), [Natural Markdown Sections](/docs/04-reference/natural-markdown-sections)

### Align (noun)

An **Align** is the shareable unit in AlignTrue. It replaces the earlier concept of a "pack" from prior terminology.

An Align can be:

- A collection of rules (e.g., `typescript.md`, `testing.md`)
- An MCP server configuration
- A skill definition
- Other shareable elements (as needed)

**Key points:**

- Capitalize **Align** (singular) and **Aligns** (plural) as proper nouns when referring to the shareable unit
- Distinguish from the verb "align" (lowercase) meaning to synchronize or keep in sync
- Can be stored locally, shared via git, or referenced remotely
- Combines metadata (ID, version, summary) with rules or other configuration

**Examples of Aligns:**

- "The TypeScript Align includes strict mode rules"
- "Import community Aligns from GitHub"
- "Create your own Align for project standards"
- `testing.md` - Testing best practices Align
- `nextjs_app_router.md` - Next.js App Router patterns Align

**File formats:** `.md` files in `.aligntrue/rules/`

**Related:** [Align Spec v1](https://github.com/AlignTrue/aligntrue/blob/main/spec/align-spec-v1.md), [Creating Aligns](/docs/07-contributing/creating-aligns)

### Align pack

The user-facing name for a pack created in the Align Catalog. An Align pack bundles multiple Aligns (by ID) into a single downloadable/shareable unit with preserved paths. CLI install is not supported today—download the zip and add the files. Internal references to "catalog pack" refer to the same pack type.

## File types & formats

### Align source files (`.aligntrue/rules/*.md`)

Primary authoring files that you edit. AlignTrue compiles these markdown Aligns into its internal IR and writes agent-specific exports from them. Treat all generated exports as read-only—update `.aligntrue/rules/*.md` and rerun `aligntrue sync` to propagate changes.

### AGENTS.md

The universal markdown export AlignTrue writes for agents that consume a shared format. Contains:

- Human-readable rule descriptions
- Natural markdown sections with YAML frontmatter
- Optional narrative sections explaining your project's standards

`AGENTS.md` is generated by `aligntrue sync` for compatible agents. Edit `.aligntrue/rules/*.md` instead of modifying this export directly.

**Related:** [Natural Markdown Sections](/docs/04-reference/natural-markdown-sections)

### Intermediate representation (IR)

The internal YAML format AlignTrue builds in memory from `.aligntrue/rules/*.md`.

**Key characteristics:**

- Normalizes Aligns for validation and exporters
- Machine-parseable, pure YAML (no markdown)
- Used internally for validation and export
- **Not stored on disk**—rerun `aligntrue sync` after editing `.aligntrue/rules/*.md`

The IR sits between your authoring files and exported agent formats:

```
.aligntrue/rules/*.md (you edit) → IR (in memory) → Agent exports (.mdc, AGENTS.md, MCP configs, etc.)
```

### Cursor rules (.mdc)

Cursor's native rule format stored in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`. Files use YAML frontmatter with markdown content optimized for Cursor's inline rule engine.

AlignTrue automatically exports your rules to `.mdc` format when you run `aligntrue sync`. Do not edit `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` directly; update `.aligntrue/rules/*.md` instead.

**Related:** [Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.sh)

### MCP Configuration

Model Context Protocol configuration stored in `.vscode/mcp.json` for VS Code and other MCP-compatible agents. Allows agents to access external tools and resources.

AlignTrue exports MCP server configurations automatically for compatible agents.

**Related:** [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)

## Operations

### Sync

The process of converting and pushing your rules to all configured agent formats. Ensures all agents stay aligned with your current rule set.

**Command:** `aligntrue sync`

**What happens:**

1. Loads your rules from `.aligntrue/rules` (and any configured sources)
2. Validates them against the Align Spec
3. Exports to all configured agent formats (.mdc, AGENTS.md, MCP configs, etc.)
4. Writes updated files to disk

**Related:** [Sync behavior](/docs/03-concepts/sync-behavior)

### Export

Converting rules from the IR (Intermediate Representation) into a specific agent's native format. AlignTrue uses **50 specialized exporters** to handle 28+ different agent formats.

Each exporter:

- Preserves rule semantics where possible
- Adapts formatting to agent requirements
- Adds **fidelity notes** when parity isn't exact

### Bundle

Merging rules from multiple Aligns/sources into a single coherent rule set (team mode only).

**When bundling happens:**

- Specified in `.aligntrue/config.yaml` under `sources`
- Multiple Aligns are resolved with precedence rules
- Dependencies are resolved recursively
- Final bundle is deterministically merged

**Related:** [Team mode](/docs/03-concepts/team-mode)

### Lockfile

A deterministic snapshot of your complete rule set with cryptographic hashes (team mode only). File: `.aligntrue/lock.json`

**Purpose:**

- Ensures reproducible deployments across machines
- Enables drift detection (detects when rules diverge)
- Pins exact versions for team collaboration
- Includes canonical SHA-256 hashes for integrity verification

Lockfiles are generated via `aligntrue sync` when team mode is enabled. Solo mode does not write a lockfile.

**Related:** [Team mode](/docs/03-concepts/team-mode), [Drift detection](/docs/03-concepts/drift-detection)

### Drift detection

Comparing your current rule state against a committed lockfile to detect when rules have changed (team mode only).

**Drift scenarios:**

- An Align was updated but the lockfile wasn't regenerated
- Rules changed in `.aligntrue/rules` without rerunning `aligntrue sync`
- A rule source is no longer accessible
- A team member pushed different rules than the lockfile

**Command:** `aligntrue drift` (in team mode)

**Related:** [Drift detection](/docs/03-concepts/drift-detection)

---

## Configuration & modes

### Solo mode

Default mode for individual developers. Optimized for fast iteration with minimal ceremony.

**Characteristics:**

- No lockfile required
- No bundle overhead
- Simple rule management
- Fast sync operations

**Use case:** Single developer, single project, local rules only

**Related:** [Solo developer guide](/docs/01-guides/01-solo-developer-guide)

### Team mode

Collaborative mode with reproducibility guarantees and approval workflows.

**Characteristics:**

- Lockfile generation for determinism
- Bundle support for multi-source rules
- Drift detection enabled

**Enable with:** `aligntrue team enable`

**Related:** [Team mode](/docs/03-concepts/team-mode), [Team guide](/docs/01-guides/02-team-guide)

### Configuration file

Main AlignTrue configuration stored in `.aligntrue/config.yaml`. Defines:

- **Mode** - `solo` or `team`
- **Sources** - Where rules come from (local files, git repositories)
- **Exporters** - Which agent formats to export to
- **Scopes** - Path-based rule application (monorepos)
- **Modules** - Feature toggles (lockfile, bundle)

**Related:** [Config reference](/docs/04-reference/config-reference)

## Advanced features

### Vendor bags

Optional agent-specific metadata stored under `vendor.<agent-name>` that preserves information during round-trip conversions.

**Purpose:**

- Store agent-specific hints that don't map to standard rule fields
- Enable lossless IR ↔ agent conversions
- Prevent loss of fidelity when syncing to different formats

**Example:**

```yaml
vendor:
  cursor:
    ai_hint: "Suggest test scaffolding with vitest"
    session_id: "xyz"
  _meta:
    volatile: ["cursor.session_id"] # Excluded from hashing
```

**Related:** [Vendor bags](/docs/04-reference/vendor-bags)

### Overlays

Customizations applied on top of third-party Aligns without forking them. Allows safe, maintainable modifications to upstream rule sets.

**Features:**

- Override specific rules
- Add new rules
- Change severity levels
- Maintain sync with upstream versions

**Related:** [Overlays](/docs/02-customization/overlays)

### Scopes

Path-based rule application for monorepos. Allows different rules to apply to different directories or projects within a single repository.

**Use cases:**

- Backend rules for `packages/api/`
- Frontend rules for `apps/web/`
- Shared infrastructure rules for root level

**Related:** [Scopes](/docs/02-customization/scopes)

### Plugs

Parameterized rule templates that accept configuration inputs. (Plugs system)

**Purpose:**

- Create reusable rule templates
- Accept configuration via `fills` in overlays
- Support community-contributed rule templates

**Related:** [Plugs](/docs/02-customization/plugs)
