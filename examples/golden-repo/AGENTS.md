## Testing requirements

Every new feature must include unit tests. Test files should be co-located with source files using the .test.ts or .spec.ts naming convention.

Examples:

- src/utils/parser.ts → src/utils/parser.test.ts
- src/components/Button.tsx → src/components/Button.test.tsx

## Code review standards

TODO comments should be converted to GitHub issues before merging. They often get forgotten in the codebase.

Instead of: // TODO: refactor this
Do: Create issue, then // Issue #123: refactor this

## Public API documentation

Public API exports should include JSDoc comments explaining their purpose and usage. This helps with IDE intellisense and documentation generation.

## Security practices

Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens to version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management instead.

Common patterns to avoid:

- API*KEY = "sk_live*..."
- password: "mypassword123"
- token: "ghp\_..."

## TypeScript type safety

Avoid using 'any' type as it defeats TypeScript's type safety. Use 'unknown' for truly unknown types, or define proper interfaces.
