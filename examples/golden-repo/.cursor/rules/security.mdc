# Security and Privacy

Never log secrets, tokens, passwords, or personal data.

## Secrets and Configuration

- Use existing secrets/configuration mechanisms (environment variables, secure vaults).
- Never hardcode or commit API keys, passwords, or tokens.
- Keep sensitive data out of version control.

Common patterns to avoid:

- API*KEY = "sk_live*..."
- password: "mypassword123"
- token: "ghp\_..."

## Input Validation

- Validate and sanitize untrusted input (file paths, user input, external data).
- Follow established authentication and authorization patterns.
- Do not bypass security checks.

## Risk Communication

- Call out potential security risks clearly, even if outside the current request.
- Be explicit about what is validated and what is not.
