# Testing Standards

Add or update tests for any nontrivial change. Use the existing test framework and patterns in this project.

## Test Quality

- Prefer fast, focused unit tests.
- Only use integration or end-to-end tests when necessary.
- Test behavior, not implementation details.
- Keep tests independent and deterministic.
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested.

## Test Design

- Tests should act as executable specs: clear names, simple setups, deterministic assertions.
- Explain why a test is missing if you cannot add one, and call out the risk.
- When fixing a bug, add a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after.
- Aim for test coverage that gives confidence in correctness (target 80%+ for critical code).

## Test Co-location

Place test files next to source files using the `.test.*` or `.spec.*` naming convention:

- src/utils/parser.ts → src/utils/parser.test.ts
- src/components/Button.tsx → src/components/Button.test.tsx
