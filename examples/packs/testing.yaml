  # Testing Baseline

  ## 5-Question Test Decision

  Before adding a test:
  1. Has this broken in CI or real usage?
  2. Is this a public contract or critical behavior?
  3. Can a unit test prove it deterministically?
  4. Will it remain fast and stable?
  5. Is maintenance worth it?

  ## Test Pyramid

  - Default to unit tests
  - Use integration only for cross-cutting seams
  - Minimal e2e where system seams require it

  ## Determinism Requirements

  - No real network
  - No filesystem side effects
  - No clocks or randomness without fakes
  - Freeze time, seed randomness, stub boundaries
  - No sleeps for sync; wait on conditions with timeouts

  ## Speed Requirements

  - Target sub-second per test
  - Investigate tests >1s
  - Prefer isolated units
  - Use local fakes instead of e2e

  ## Structure

  - Organize by type: unit, integration, e2e
  - One behavioral topic per test file
  - Name files after behavior under test

  ## Assertions

  - Prove behavior, not implementation
  - Prefer public interfaces
  - Observable outcomes

  ## Fixtures

  - Keep small and local
  - Prefer builders/factories
  - Golden files only for stable outputs

  ## External Systems

  - Use fakes or emulators
  - Database, queue, cache, HTTP replaced
  - Isolate true e2e, keep minimal

  ## Flakiness

  - Don't mark flaky by default
  - Quarantine with issue link
  - Short timebox
  - Fix or delete

  ## Coverage

  - Enforce threshold in CI if configured
  - Don't chase 100%
  - Focus on critical paths

  ## CI

  - Block on test failures
  - Publish reports
  - Fail on coverage threshold miss
