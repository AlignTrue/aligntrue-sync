  # Test-Driven Development

  ## Core Workflow

  1. **Red**: Write failing test
  2. **Green**: Minimal change to pass
  3. **Refactor**: Improve with safety

  ## Red Phase

  - Pick one behavior
  - Define smallest observable contract
  - Place in correct test folder (unit/integration/e2e)
  - Assert outcomes, not implementation
  - Make it deterministic
  - Verify it fails for right reason

  ## Green Phase

  - Implement only what test demands
  - No preemptive features
  - Keep changes minimal
  - Prefer small pure functions
  - Re-run until green

  ## Refactor Phase

  - Improve names
  - Factor duplication
  - Clarify boundaries
  - Run fmt and lint
  - Ensure tests stay green

  ## Test Requirements

  - Fast and isolated
  - No sleep-based timing
  - Quarantine flakiness immediately
  - Fix quickly

  ## Commit Discipline

  - Order: red test, green change, refactor
  - Squash before merge if needed
  - PR must include test and docs

  ## CI Enforcement

  - CI runs tests
  - Block merge on failures
  - Enforce coverage if configured

  ## When in Doubt

  - Tighten the contract
  - Add regression test first for bugs
  - Specify inputs/outputs over mocks
