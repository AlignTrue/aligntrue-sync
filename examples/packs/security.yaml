  # Security and Compliance Baseline

  ## Core Principles

  - Never commit secrets (treat repo as public)
  - Control dependencies and registries
  - Enforce license compliance
  - Run static analysis (SAST)
  - Build with least privilege and provenance
  - Keep data and logs safe

  ## Secrets Management

  - Pre-commit and CI scans required
  - Store runtime secrets only in approved manager
  - If leaked: revoke, rotate, add regression check

  ## Supply Chain

  - Require lockfiles and pinned versions
  - No floating ranges in CI or production
  - Audit on every PR
  - Allow only approved registries
  - Schedule regular updates

  ## License Compliance

  - Check third-party licenses
  - Block disallowed or unknown licenses
  - Document exceptions

  ## SAST and Container Scanning

  - Execute SAST in CI (high findings blocking)
  - Scan containers if applicable
  - Use pinned base images

  ## Build Provenance

  - CI with least privilege
  - Generate SBOM for each release
  - Sign artifacts when enabled

  ## Data Safety

  - No production data in tests
  - Redact secrets/PII in logs
  - Follow data classification policy

  ## CI Gates

  - Block merge on scan failures
  - Surface reports as artifacts
  - Keep logs free of secrets
