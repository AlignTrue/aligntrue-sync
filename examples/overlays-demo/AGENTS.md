# AlignTrue Overlays Demo

**Version:** v1
**Generated by:** AlignTrue

This file demonstrates fork-safe customization of upstream rule packs using overlays.

## Avoid console.log in production code

Use proper logging library instead of console.log.
Console statements can leak sensitive information and
clutter production logs.

Good: logger.info("User logged in")
Bad: console.log("User logged in")

## Limit cyclomatic complexity

Keep functions simple with cyclomatic complexity under threshold.
Complex functions are hard to test and maintain.

Refactor complex functions into smaller, focused functions.

## Use const for variables that are never reassigned

Use const instead of let for variables that are never reassigned.
This makes code more predictable and prevents accidental reassignment.

Good: const user = getUser();
Bad: let user = getUser();
