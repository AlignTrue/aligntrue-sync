# Sample Agent Rules

This is a sample AGENTS.md file for testing.

## Code Quality

All code must follow these quality standards:

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the project style guide

## Testing Required

Every feature must have tests:

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- E2E tests for critical paths

## Security

Security is paramount:

- Never commit secrets
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
